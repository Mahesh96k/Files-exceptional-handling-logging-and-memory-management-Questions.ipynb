        "01. Difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted languages run line by line (like Python), while compiled ones are converted into machine code before execution (like C++). Interpreted ones are easier to debug but generally slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "02. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s a way to deal with errors during runtime using try, except, and other related blocks so your program doesn’t crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "03. Purpose of the finally block?\n",
        "\n",
        "The finally block runs no matter what—whether there’s an error or not. It’s often used for cleanup tasks like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "04. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging helps you keep track of events in your program. It’s super helpful for debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "05. Significance of __del__ method?\n",
        "\n",
        "__del__ is a destructor method in Python that’s called when an object is deleted. It can be used to free resources or clean up.\n",
        "\n",
        "06. Difference between import and from ... import?\n",
        "\n",
        "import brings in the whole module, while from ... import lets you pull in specific parts of it, making the code a bit cleaner.\n",
        "\n",
        "07. How to handle multiple exceptions?\n",
        "\n",
        "You can catch multiple exceptions by using multiple except blocks or a single block with a tuple of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "08. Purpose of with statement for files?\n",
        "\n",
        "It automatically manages file opening and closing, even if an error occurs. Super handy and clean.\n",
        "\n",
        "09. Multithreading vs multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading runs multiple threads in a single process (good for I/O tasks), while multiprocessing runs separate processes (better for CPU-heavy tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Advantages of using logging?\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging gives you a way to track events, errors, and warnings in your code, which is helpful for debugging and understanding how your app behaves.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s how Python allocates and frees up memory as your program runs. Python does this mostly automatically using reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Basic steps in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Use try to write code that might fail, except to handle the error, else for code that runs if no error occurs, and finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important?\n",
        "\n",
        "It ensures that your program runs efficiently without consuming unnecessary resources or crashing due to memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Role of try and except in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "They let you test risky code (try) and respond gracefully if something goes wrong (except), avoiding crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does garbage collection work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses reference counting and a garbage collector to automatically free memory used by objects no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The else block runs if no exceptions are raised in the try. It’s a good place for code that should only run when everything goes fine.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The main levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. They help categorize how serious an event is.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "os.fork() is a low-level way to create processes on Unix. multiprocessing is a higher-level, cross-platform way to work with multiple processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Importance of closing a file?\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don’t close files, you might run into memory leaks or locked files. It’s just good hygiene when working with files.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Difference between file.read() and file.readline()?\n",
        "\n",
        "read() reads the whole file as a string, while readline() reads just one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s used to record messages about your program’s execution, which helps with debugging, tracking bugs, or analyzing performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. Use of the os module in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The os module helps you interact with the file system—creating, deleting, or checking file paths and directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. Challenges in memory management?\n",
        "\n",
        "Managing memory leaks, circular references, and optimizing performance can be tricky, especially in large or long-running apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How to raise an exception manually?\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use the raise keyword followed by an exception. For example: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why use multithreading in some applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps you do multiple things at once—like downloading files or handling user input—without freezing your program."
